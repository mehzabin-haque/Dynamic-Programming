# Dynamic Programming and Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains various dynamic programming and algorithm implementations in Python. Each code snippet is designed to solve specific problems efficiently.

## List of Algorithms:

### 1. **Greedy Algorithm**: Implements a greedy approach to solve optimization problems by making locally optimal choices.

### 2. **Activity Problem and Knapsack**: Solves the activity selection problem and 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

### 3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Finds the longest common subsequence between two sequences using dynamic programming.

   Example: For sequences "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR", the LCS is "ADH".

### 4. **Longest Increasing Sequence (LIS) using LCS**: Determines the LIS of a sequence using the LCS algorithm.

   Example: For the sequence [3, 10, 2, 1, 20], the LIS is [3, 10, 20].

### 5. **LIS in a Faster Way**: A more optimized approach to find the LIS of a sequence using dynamic programming.

   Example: For the sequence [50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80], the LIS is [3, 7, 40, 80].

### 6. **Coin Change**: Calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using dynamic programming.

   Example: For denominations [1, 2, 5] and amount 5, there are 4 ways to make change: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], and [5].

### 7. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Finds the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices using dynamic programming.

### 8. **Edit Distance**: Computes the minimum operations required to convert one string into another using dynamic programming.

   Example: For strings "kitten" and "sitting", the edit distance is 3 (replace "k" with "s", "e" with "i", and add "g" at the end).

### 9. **KMP Algorithm**: Implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for pattern matching in strings.

### 10. **Robin-Karp Algorithm**: Utilizes the Robin-Karp algorithm for pattern matching in strings using hashing.

### 11. **Pattern Match Naive Approach**: A naive approach to find all occurrences of a pattern in a text.

### 12. **Rod Cutting**: Determines the maximum value that can be obtained by cutting a rod into smaller pieces.

### 13. **Chocolate Breaking**: Calculates the minimum number of breaks required to split a chocolate bar into smaller squares.

### 14. **Rock Climbing**: Solves a rock climbing problem using dynamic programming to find the maximum points attainable.
